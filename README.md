## üí° Our Solution: The Smart Shopping Assistant

We are building a **"Smart Shopping Assistant,"** an AI-powered recommendation system prototype that provides a personalized and intelligent shopping experience. Our solution analyzes retailer-specific data to offer relevant suggestions, helping them discover new products and optimize their inventory effortlessly.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Personalized Product Recommendations**: Uses AI to suggest products based on purchase history, browsing behavior, and market trends.
* **Real-time Suggestions**: Leverages a Kafka data stream to capture live user behavior, ensuring recommendations are always fresh and relevant.
* **Natural Language Queries**: Integrates the **Gemini API** to allow retailers to ask conversational questions (e.g., "What new beverage brands are popular this summer?").
* **Optimized Inventory Management**: Helps retailers break free from repetitive buying patterns and discover high-potential new products.
* **Scalable Architecture**: Built on a microservices architecture to ensure reliability and future growth.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Our prototype is built with a modern and powerful tech stack:

* **Frontend**: `React` (for a dynamic and responsive user interface)
* **Backend**: `Node.js` (for handling real-time user interactions efficiently)
* **Database**: `MongoDB` (for flexibility with complex product catalogs)
* **AI / Machine Learning**: `TensorFlow` (for building robust recommendation models)
* **Real-time Data Stream**: `Apache Kafka` (for capturing live event data)
* **API Integration**: `Gemini API` (for advanced natural language features)
